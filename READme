# Cell Line Classification Project

## Description

This project aims to classify 9 regularly misidentified cell lines based on microscopy images. The goal is to distinguish between the following cell lines:

PC-3
U-251 MG
HeLa
A549
U-2 OS
MCF7
HEK 293
CACO-2
RT4

Each sample contains at least one cell and consists of 3 separate images showing different parts of the same cell:

Nucleus
Microtubules
Endoplasmic reticulum


# Single-Step Retrosynthesis Prediction

<img src="https://github.com/AdamAdonyi/Single-Step-Retrosynthesis-Prediction/blob/main/retro_picture.png">


## Description

This project focuses on developing methods for single-step retrosynthesis prediction in chemical reactions. Given a dataset of chemical reactions in the format "[Reactants' SMILES]>>[Products' SMILES]", the goal is to train a machine learning model that can predict the reactants' SMILES starting from a new product SMILES.

## Project Overview

The project uses a [BART](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large) (transformer encoder-decoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder) model for the task of retrosynthesis prediction. Originally, it was release in [2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) and trained on English language. Here's a brief overview:
