## üñºÔ∏è Image Preprocessing Methodology

### Multi-Channel Image Composition
Our unique approach combines three grayscale images representing different cellular compartments:

1. **Nucleus Channel**: Structural foundation
2. **Microtubules Channel**: Cellular infrastructure
3. **Endoplasmic Reticulum Channel**: Cellular processing network

#### Image Transformation Example
